This repository based on sms.ir official repository for all versions of laravel. I make this repository because the official version won't work with laravel 6 or newer.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require cryptommer/smsirlaravel
```

## Usage

You can use this repository just like official version.
